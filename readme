DevExpress offers a great installer for their componets and frameworks. 
But if you work in a continuous integration environment or have to deal with different versions of the components,
NuGet packages are the better way to deploy and version-control dependencies. 
This project contains .nuspec files for  DevExpress WinForms, Web and XAF assemblies. 

This is not an official release and  is not supported by DevExpress.
